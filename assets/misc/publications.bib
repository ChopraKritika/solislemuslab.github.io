  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The abundance of gene flow in the Tree of Life
              challenges the notion that evolution can be represented with a
              fully bifurcating process which cannot capture important
              biological realities like hybridization, introgression, or
              horizontal gene transfer. Coalescent-based network methods are
              increasingly popular, yet not scalable for big data, because they
              need to perform a heuristic search in the space of networks as
              well as numerical optimization that can be NP-hard. Here, we
              introduce a novel method to reconstruct phylogenetic networks
              based on algebraic invariants. While there is a long tradition of
              using algebraic invariants in phylogenetics, our work is the
              first to define phylogenetic invariants on concordance factors
              (frequencies of four-taxon splits in the input gene trees) to
              identify level-1 phylogenetic networks under the multispecies
              coalescent model. RESULTS: Our novel hybrid detection methodology
              is optimization-free as it only requires the evaluation of
              polynomial equations, and as such, it bypasses the traversal of
              network space, yielding a computational speed at least 10 times
              faster than the fastest-to-date network methods. We illustrate
              our method's performance on simulated and real data from the
              genus Canis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We present an

              multicellular spatial structures called colonies, which contain
              characteristic sizes, shapes, edges, textures, and degrees of
              opacity and color. For over one hundred years, researchers have
              used these morphology cues to classify bacteria and guide more
              targeted treatment of pathogens. Advances in genome sequencing
              technology have revolutionized our ability to classify bacterial
              isolates and while genomic methods are in the ascendancy,
              morphological characterization of bacterial species has made a
              resurgence due to increased computing capacities and widespread
              application of machine learning tools. In this paper, we revisit
              the topic of colony morphotype on the within-species scale and
              apply concepts from image processing, computer vision, and deep
              learning to a dataset of 69 environmental and clinical
              Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. We find that colony morphology
              and complexity under common laboratory conditions is a robust,
              repeatable phenotype on the level of individual strains, and
              therefore forms a potential basis for strain classification. We
              then use a deep convolutional neural network approach with a
              combination of data augmentation and transfer learning to
              overcome the typical data starvation problem in biological
              applications of deep learning. Using a train/validation/test
              split, our results achieve an average validation accuracy of
              92.9\% and an average test accuracy of 90.7\% for the
              classification of individual strains. These results indicate that
              bacterial strains have characteristic visual 'fingerprints' that
              can serve as the basis of classification on a sub-species level.
              Our work illustrates the potential of image-based classification
              of bacterial pathogens and highlights the potential to use
              similar approaches to predict medically relevant strain
              characteristics like antibiotic resistance and virulence from

                   simplicity, unsupervised learning has not been sufficiently

                   main reason for the delay in adoption of unsupervised
                   learning in phylogenetics is the lack of a meaningful, yet
